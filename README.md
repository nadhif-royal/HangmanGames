# HangmanGames
This is a Hangman-style quiz game from the 30 Days Marathon Python Code by Bagus (Gede Tanock) on Day 14. Players must save "Budi" by answering questions correctly. Each mistake reduces Nadhif's 6 lives. The game provides immediate feedback and allows players to continue or exit after each question.
